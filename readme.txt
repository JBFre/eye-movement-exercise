# Eyeball Animation README

This code creates a simple animation of two eyes that follow the movement of the user's mouse pointer.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the code repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Move your mouse within the browser window to see the eyes track its movement.

## Code Structure

The code consists of three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `eyes.js`.

- `index.html` is the HTML file that defines the structure of the document and includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.
- `styles.css` contains the styles and animations for the eyes and eyeballs.
- `eyes.js` contains the JavaScript code responsible for animating the eyeballs based on the mouse position.

## Customization

- To change the background color, modify the `background` property in the CSS section of the `styles.css` file.
- Adjust the size and positioning of the eyes and eyeballs by modifying the corresponding CSS properties in the `styles.css` file.
- You can further customize the animation or add additional functionality by modifying the JavaScript code in the `eyes.js` file.

## Compatibility

This code is compatible with modern web browsers that support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Planned Upgrades

- Add blinking animation to the eyes for a more realistic effect.
- Implement different eye shapes and colors for customization options.
- Add a control panel to adjust the animation speed or enable/disable the eyeball tracking.
- Improve mobile responsiveness for a better user experience on different devices.
